# C/C++ Configurations

c/c++ intelliSense configurations

## Not Need To Configure

EIDE will use cpptool CustomConfiguraionProvider to provide your c/c++ project config.

So **don't configure** 'c_cpp_properties.json' file. If you do that, the c/c++ intelliSense will not work well.

:::caution Notice
We not need `c_cpp_properties.json` file in your EIDE project.<br>
This file interferes with the behavior of C/C++ plug-in. In EIDE projects, please remove it !
