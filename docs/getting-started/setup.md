# Setup

Install Eide on your pc and setup development envrionment.

## Precondition

This plug-in base on VSCode, if you are going to use it, please:

- **Make sure you're familiar with VSCode**
- **Make sure you're familiar with the basic build process of c/c++ project**

Because this docs takes the above conditions as the premise.

## Install EIDE

In this section, we will guide you on how to properly install `EIDE`.

:::caution We Need Network
We need download some packages from network, make sure your network is ok !<br/>
If you need to install **offline**, please goto [**Github Release**](https://github.com/github0null/eide/releases) to download installation package.
:::

- Open vscode extension market, search `eide`, select `Embedded IDE` and install it.

  ![](/docs_img/install_from_market.png)

- When the plug-in has been installed, it will launch and start to init.

  The plug-in will **auto download and install** [eide-binaries](https://github.com/github0null/eide-resource/tree/master/binaries) and [.NET6 X64 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) package, please wait !

  ![](/docs_img/install_dotnet.png)

- When `.NET Runtime` has been installed, you need to restart vscode to refresh `System Environment Variables`.

  EIDE will check `.NET Runtime` before launch, goto VSCode `Output Panel` to check log.

When you have completed the above operations, EIDE will be installed normally on your computer and we are now ready to begin.

:::caution Not found runtime
Sometimes, the runtime is installed, but plug-in still prompts that it **cannot be found**.<br/>
You may need **close all vscode instances** and execute command `code .` in shell to refresh `System Environment Variables`.
:::

:::info How to install dotnet on Unix platform
You can install dotnet to the global environment using the system's package manager. If you are unable to access the package manager, you can follow these steps to install it:<br/>
1. Run [dotnet-install.sh](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/scripts) to install.<br/>
2. Run `ln -s ~/.dotnet/dotnet ~/.local/bin/dotnet` to add a symbol link.<br/>
3. Logout and login, then restart vscode.<br/>
:::

:::caution .NET Runtime Version
If you want to install the .NET runtime manually, you must install a version with **major** version number **6** (e.g. v6.0.5).
[Click here to download the runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
:::

## Function Region Layout

Now we'll walk you through the functional areas of the plug-in.

![](/docs_img/eide_func_area.png)

- **EIDE PROJECTS**: Project View

  The `EIDE PROJECTS` area will display the projects you have open.

  ![](/docs_img/eide_prj_area.png)

- **OPERATIONS**: Operations View

  The `OPERATIONS` area will display some `Common Commands` for user.

  ![](/docs_img/eide_operations.png)

## Configure Toolchains

EIDE support many toolchains, but these package is so big, so we **not built-in** them in plug-in, you need to install manualy.

Click `Configure Toolchain` item in `OPERATIONS` view.

Then a `quickpick box` will be pop-up. You need to choose the compiler you want to use and set its installation path.

If you configure done, a check mark 'âœ”' will be appeared after the item.

![](/docs_img/toolchains.png)

:::tip What is the "Toolchain Installation Folder Path" ?
The `Toolchain Installation Folder` is the **root path** for your compiler.<br/>
example:<br/>
  - If your gcc compiler path is: `d:/software/my_toolchain/arm_gcc_10/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc.exe`
  - Now, you need set `d:/software/my_toolchain/arm_gcc_10` as your arm gcc `Toolchain Installation Folder` in EIDE.
:::

:::tip Install Toolchain by EIDE
For Windows platform, EIDE provide some online installation package for `Open Source Toolchains`.<br/>
So you can use [Install Utility Tools](../advance/install_tools) function or select an existing installation location.
:::

### Automatically Detect Toolchains

Each toolchain has a corresponding plugin setting. If its value is "empty", the plugin will automatically detect the available toolchains from the environment variables.

|Toolchain Name|Plugin Setting|The Command Used For Detection|
|----|----|----|
|IAR Arm Compiler|EIDE.IAR.ARM.Toolchain.InstallDirectory|`iccarm`|
|GNU Toolchain For Arm|EIDE.ARM.GCC.InstallDirectory|`${EIDE.ARM.GCC.Prefix}gcc`|
|LLVM For Arm|EIDE.ARM.LLVM.InstallDirectory|`clang`|
|Arm Compiler V5|EIDE.ARM.ARMCC5.InstallDirectory|`armcc`|
|Arm Compiler V6|EIDE.ARM.ARMCC6.InstallDirectory|`armclang`|
|Small Device C Compiler|EIDE.SDCC.InstallDirectory|`sdcc`|
|GNU Toolchain For RISCV|EIDE.RISCV.InstallDirectory|`${EIDE.RISCV.ToolPrefix}gcc`|
|GNU Toolchain For MIPS|EIDE.MIPS.InstallDirectory|`${EIDE.MIPS.ToolPrefix}gcc`|
|Unknown GCC|EIDE.Toolchain.AnyGcc.InstallDirectory|`${EIDE.Toolchain.AnyGcc.ToolPrefix}gcc`|

#### For Linux Platform

Please use the package manager to install the toolchain, such as `apt install arm-none-eabi-gcc`, etc

Alternatively, you can append the path of the compiler's bin directory into the system's `PATH` variable, which can be achieved by modifying `~/.profile`.

#### For Windows Platform

Download the installation package of the corresponding compiler by yourself from the network and execute the installation.

Then open the computer Settings, set the system environment variables, and then append the Path of the compiler's bin directory to the system environment variable: `Path`.

Then just restart VSCode.
