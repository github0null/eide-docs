Install external tools, programs

## Utility Tools

We provide some external utility tools on [github repository](https://github.com/github0null/eide_default_external_tools_index).

You can install these tools by eide, as follows:

![](/docs_img/install_ext_tools.png)

These tools will be installed to `<user_home>/.eide/tools` folder, and eide will export `bin` path to extension system environment variables.

:::tip Not Found Tools For Linux
`Linux` software mostly has dependencies. So most of the tools we provide are for `Windows`.<br/>
Please use system package manager to install linux softwares.
