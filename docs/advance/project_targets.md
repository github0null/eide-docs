# Project Targets

Switch target in a project.

## Switch Target

We support add some target for one project.

Each target has their independent `builder options`, `project attributes`, `flasher configurations`.

- At first, right-click project view to open menu items, and click `Switch Target`

  ![](/docs_img/prj_switch_target_btn.png)

- Then, eide will popup a target list.

  Now you can `add new target`, `delete target` or `click target name to switch`

:::tip When to use Target
When you want to use more than one build configuration, but use the same source code,<br/>
you can create different Target to distinguish them in the same project.
